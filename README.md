# Memory Lane

Memory Lane is a web application designed to help users create, store, and share their cherished memories with friends and family. This platform allows users to organize their memories chronologically, providing a structured way to relive past moments in an intuitive and visually appealing format.

## Features

- **User Selection**: Users can choose a profile to access their memory lane.
- **Memory Lane**: Displays a chronological collection of events.
- **Memory Cards**: Each event includes a title, description, timestamp, and at least one image.
- **Sorting & Filtering**: Users can sort memories by date and filter them by time periods.
- **Memory Details & Editing**: Users can view detailed information about a memory and update or delete it.
- **Memory Creation**: Users can add new memories with a title, description, date, location, and image upload functionality.
- **Sharing**: Users can copy and share their memory lane URL with others.
- **Error Handling**: A custom 404 page ensures smooth navigation.

## Tech Stack & Justification

### **Framework & Language**

- **Next.js (App Router)**: Chosen for its improved performance with server components, simplified routing, and built-in optimizations.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and improves maintainability, reducing potential runtime errors.

### **Styling & UI**

- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid development with utility-first styling, ensuring a clean and consistent design.
- **ShadCN**: Provides accessible and well-designed UI components, improving development speed.
- **Framer Motion**: Used for smooth animations, enhancing user experience.

### **State Management & API**

- **Zustand**: A lightweight and flexible state management library that simplifies global state handling.
- **Next.js Services**: Utilized for API handling, ensuring a streamlined backend structure directly within the Next.js app.

### **Backend & Storage**

- **Supabase (Postgres & Storage)**: Selected for its ease of use, scalability, and native support for Postgres and file storage.

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation covers the core functionality, there are several enhancements that could be introduced:

- **Multiple Image Uploads**: Currently, only one image is supported per memory. Adding support for multiple images would improve the experience.
- **Infinite Scrolling/Pagination**: Instead of loading all memories at once, implementing infinite scrolling or pagination would improve performance.
- **User Authentication & Privacy Controls**: Right now, any user can access memory lanes. In the future, adding authentication and privacy settings would enable users to manage public and private lanes.
- **Social Features**: Features like liking or commenting on memories could improve user engagement.
- **Improved Design & UX Enhancements**: Adding animations, transitions, and other visual enhancements would improve the user experience.

## API Updates

The API has been modified to:

- Support creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting memories.
- Store images in Supabase Storage and metadata in Supabase Postgres.
- Handle user data retrieval.
- Utilize Next.js service functions for efficient backend operations.

## Notes

- Authentication is **not** required for this iteration.
- The mockup provided was used as inspiration, with UX improvements added.
- Users can interact with the platform without persistent login.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on **Vercel**, making it accessible for easy testing and review.
